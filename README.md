# find your true calling
## using this app helps people to figure out what professions would suit them best. For this we collect data of current skills, licenses,other stuff, and also we ask about dreams, wishes, things they liked to do in the past, and one day dreamed of making a living of.
## Once we got this data, first we recommend jobs, and show other jobs which require similar skills or time, or location that the user selected. We show what skills or education is required to do that kind of job.
## Hopefully in the future we can add training programs as well, hopefully we can get educational institutes to support this site and offer trainings for the chosen career path.
